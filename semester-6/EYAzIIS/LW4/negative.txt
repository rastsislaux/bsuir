Artificial intelligence (AI) is a colossal disappointment, and the companies touting its greatness are nothing but deceitful charlatans. AlphaCorp's healthcare AI is a dangerous joke, BetaTech's platform is a costly mess, and GammaSoft's stock market predictions are a complete disaster. AI is a deceitful, overhyped sham that has left us all bitterly disappointed and enraged.
